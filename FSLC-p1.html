            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>

            <p>Free-space laser communication is a method of using lasers to transmit data without the use of media, such as optical cables. I have been interested in the properties of lasers and its applications for more than a year. When I learned that NASA is now working on developing free-space laser communication technologies, I became curious due to its inherent advantages, which are as below:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Free-space laser communication does not require a fiber optic cable. This makes it adaptable to areas where installing infrastructures are a challenge, such as space communication, communication at remote areas, disastrous areas, and emergency requirements.</li>
              <br>

              <li>Since free-space communication requires line of sight conditions, it is totally secured, compared to radio communication.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Since laser beams are collimated and coherent, there is low beam divergence, which results in tremendous power saving. This power saving property is extremely useful in long distance space-ship communication and applications where equipment size is constrained to be small.</li>
             </ol>

            <p>As I tried to design a free-space laser communication system, I could not find enough research material that was relevant to my requirement. That prompted me to start this project. This project focused on researching to find the optimum design for a free-space laser communication transceiver system. In this project, a signal was superimposed on a carrier laser beam, using amplitude modulation. The bias voltages were optimized for the system by plotting its input/output characteristics and choosing the right operating voltage range. </p>

            <p>Purpose: Is it possible to design a free-space (wireless) laser communication system, with commonly available components, that uses laser as a carrier wave to carry audio signals with minimum distortion?</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Objective</h2>

            <p>The objective of this experiment was to design a modulator circuit for a laser beam and test if the laser beam could be successfully modulated to carry an audio signal through free space.</p>

            <div class="text-center">
              <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/free space laser communication 9.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
            </div>           
            

            <p>It is possible to design a modulator for audio signals using a class A amplifier circuit made out of commonly available components. This modulator can modulate the output power of a laser source linearly. The emitted laser can be detected wirelessly at a distance and demodulated to retrieve the audio signal with minimum distortion.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Using commonly used transistors, it is possible to design a class A amplifier for audio signals. (Class A amplifiers have linear input/output characteristics, which mean that the signals are amplified without distortion. Class A amplification happens over specific voltage ranges.)</li>
              <br>
              <li>The output currents of the above amplifier can be used to modulate a laser source. </li>
              <br>
              <li>Laser diodes, when biased forward, have power outputs that are linearly related to the current over specific operating ranges.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Laser detectors, such as photovoltaic cells, have a range of output voltages that are linearly related to the incident radiation power. </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Considering the above premises, it is possible that there could be an overlapping voltage range that is common to all the above systems where their input/output characteristics are linear.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            

            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Stage 1</h2>


            <p>A variable voltage supply circuit was chosen, modified and fabricated, capable of providing stable voltages from 0V - 12V. Potentiometers used for course and fine adjustment of input voltage.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Stage 2</h2>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">Linear Range of Photovoltaic Output and Corresponding Laser Voltage Range</blockquote>

            <p>A class A biased single stage audio amplifier was chosen, modified and fabricated. The laser source was connected to it. The input/output characteristic of the laser source was experimented on, to see if the laser source was capable of responding to audio frequencies.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, the output was tested to see if it was linearly related to the input at some input range. The output intensity of the laser beam was detected and measured using a photovoltaic cell, which also worked as a receiver in the final system.</p>

            <p>Transistor:<br> I chose the 2N3904 as it had its β (hfe) peaking at 10mA. 10mA is close to the laser source’s maximum current capacity which was around 30mA</p>

            <p><b>Data and Observations</b></p>
            <p>The following are the observations and the graph from Stage 2. The input voltage (supply voltage from the variable voltage power supply) was varied and corresponding voltages from the photovoltaic cell was measured and tabulated.
            </p>

            <p>From the above graph, we can see that the laser’s turn-on threshold is around 2.86V and the saturation voltage is around 3.66V.</p>
            <p>From the above graph, we can observe that the input/output characteristic is a straight line between 2.92V and 3.22V.</p>

            <p>Based on this range the voltage drop across the laser for the voltages between the above two linear voltage boundaries was measured.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">Amplifier Linear Output Range and Overlap with Laser Voltage Range</blockquote>

            <p>The class A biased single stage audio amplifier, from stage 2, was configured to drive and modulate the laser. It was then given different input voltages and the output voltages were measured. The objective was to find if there was an output voltage range for the class A amplifier that would match with the input voltage range of the laser. The match should be in such a way that both these devices would be aligned within the same voltage range that has linear input/output relationship.</p>

            <p>The base bias resistor was replaced by a trimmer potentiometer in order to facilitate variable biasing at the transistor base.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Laser Modulator</span>             

            <p>For each supply voltage, I changed the bias voltages over a range using the potentiometer, and observed the voltage across the laser for each distinct value. This was to see if it was within the laser’s linear voltage range.</p>

            <p>Input Voltage (Laser Voltages in Linear Range): <b>3.4 V</b></p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Base Voltage Vs Laser Voltage - Input: 3.4V</span>  

            <p>Since V<sub>L</sub> was linearly varying with V<sub>B</sub> (base voltage), the modulator operated in class A configuration</p>
            <p>Even though this configuration was offering a linear range between 1.54V and 1.76V for the V<sub>B</sub>, this entire range was not usable since the linear input/output voltage range for the laser did not exactly coincide with this range.Comparing the graph from Stage 2 as well as the current graph above, I got the following ranges for V<sub>L</sub>: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Range of 2.447V to 2.597V from Stage 2 </li>
              <li>Range of 2.42V to 2.54V from Stage 3</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The overlapping range was from <b>2.447V to 2.54V</b>. This was the only range where the laser output linearly varied with the base voltage of the modulator for a supply voltage of 3.4V</p>

            <p><b>The voltage bandwidth = 2.54V - 2.447V = 0.093V </b></p>

            <p>I repeated the above analysis with a supply voltage of 3.3 V</p>
            <p>Input Voltage (Laser Voltages in Linear Range): <b>3.3 V</b></p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Base Voltage Vs Potential Difference Across Laser and Collector Voltage - 3.3.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Base Voltage Vs Laser Voltage - Input: 3.3V</span> 

            <p>Comparing the graph from Stage 2 as well as the curent graph above, I got the followoing ranges for V<sub>L</sub>:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Range of 2.447V to 2.597V from Stage 2 </li>
              <li>Range of 2.46V to 2.6V from Stage 3</li>
            </ol>

            <p><b>The voltage bandwidth = 2.597V - 2.46V = 0.137V </b></p>
            <br>

            <p>Therefore, the two scenarios were:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>For Supply Voltage = 3.4V<br>Voltage Range for Linear Operation = 2.447V to 2.54V<br>Therefore, Voltage Bandwidth = 2.54V – 2.447V = 0.093V </li>
              <br>
              <li>For Supply Voltage = 3.3V<br> Voltage Range for Linear Operation = 2.46V to 2.597V<br> Therefore, Voltage Bandwidth = 2.597V – 2.46V = 0.137V</li>
            </ol>
            <br>

            <p>The supply voltage of 3.3V gave a better bandwidth. Therefore 3.3V was the ideal supply voltage. </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">Final Test of Transmitter/Receiver Combination with a 1kHz audio frequency</blockquote>
